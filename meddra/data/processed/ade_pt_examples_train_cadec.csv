after about 4 years of taking lipitor i started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my buddocks and stomach as well. the pain was so bad i could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take advil for the pain. i asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the lipitor. recently i experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. the stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad i could not sleep. i had just gotten over a urinery tract infection and i thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. i still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and i would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. i remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that i was experiencing. i stopped taking the lipitor for a day and i did not have any mor. i think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects. i don't want to be a case-study when they finally take this drug off the market.,stomach pain,abdominal pain upper

"i have been complaining to a variety of doctors about severe muscle cramping that has been affecting me for the past three years, which started upon waking one morning with what felt like a shark biting into my right calf. i'd been taking zocor for years and had recently been switched to lipitor. not one of the doctors once mentioned the statin as a possible cause of this problem. i wake up each morning feeling paralyzed all over my body. as if i have rigor mortis and am being resurrected from death (no exaggeration). thanks for this website and to all you people who have shared your experiences of lipitor. i finally have my answer!!! . this drug has been destroying every aspect of my life. physical and psychological. it's destroyed my self-confidence, my sex life, my business. and now it looks and feels like the medical establishment is keeping it all a dirty little secret for the sake of the income that statins generate. i'd rather have died outright from a heart attack than suffer as i have the past three years. and, reading this website, i can find a little comfort in knowing that i am not alone with this maddening array of weird symptoms. thank you! thank you!!! you may have saved my life !!!.",severe muscle cramping,muscle spasms

"i am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005. the patient data is reported for him by me. briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). that cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial rx for lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. there were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. my father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. he and the cardiologist agreed to go to lipitor to see if they could drive ldl below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). i will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what i know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. my father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life.",neurological damage,nervous system disorder

"anxiety, paranoia. i went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. first he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about lipitor's psychiatric side effects. he therefore put me off lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg crestor. in addition, he prescribed a new medication: niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). bottom line: when i discontinued lipitor two months ago my ldl reached 165. this week my blood test indicated an ldl level of 124. so, after being helped by folks on this website i hope i can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. therefore, here is what i've done during the past two months: - took 500mg of niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - took a total of 10 crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - two natural pills of phytosterol. - a cup of tea made of olive leafs. now, i do believe that when i reach the maximum intake of niacin in two months (2,000mg) the ldl will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics). good luck, folks!.",anxiety,anxiety

"temporary constipation relieved by fiber supplements, gone after about 6 weeks. possibly increased hair loss - (and i am female so it is really unfortunate) but thinning hair among women at my age also runs in my mothers family so can't really blame statins. i have a lipid problem that doesn't respond to diet or exercise. agressive cholesterol management is my only option. liptor works. i take 40mgs/day, may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months. my doctor put me on coq 10 at the same time as the lipitor, and explained possible side effects. lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers. 4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 lipitor. no serious bad effects. try coq 10 to prevent/reduce side effects.",hair loss,alopecia
